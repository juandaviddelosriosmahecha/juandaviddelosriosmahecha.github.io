I am a Physics student at Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, with a strong interest in computational physics, statistical mechanics, and biophysics. I am passionate about applying quantitative methods, scientific programming, and numerical techniques to study complex systems and develop data-driven solutions.

I have experience developing computational models and simulations using Python and C++ for the analysis of physical systems. My work includes statistical analysis, data visualization, and data-driven modeling, supported by a solid foundation in applied mathematics and statistics.

I am also actively involved in quantum computing, with hands-on experience using Qiskit to explore quantum algorithms and simulations, along with a strong understanding of their theoretical foundations.

Technical skills:
• Python, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy
• Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Statistics
• Scientific Computing, Numerical Methods
• C++, Fortran, Git
• Quantum Computing, Qiskit

I am open to opportunities for learning, research, and work in data science, machine learning, statistical mechanics, biophysics, computational physics, and quantum computing, with a strong interest in interdisciplinary applications.
